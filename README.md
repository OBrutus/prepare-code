# prepare-code
An applet which is handy for programmers and competative coders

Use simple line 
```
        python3 init.py
```

## How does this work
1. It takes the template from the local dir if exist else takes from the specified location within cloud (default: [Github Template Java Code](https://github.com/OBrutus/prepare-code/blob/mainline/template.java ))

2. Post it set's the paramets helpful for coding

3. Create a dir and save the contest wise file's

###### This will create the dir. currently only in case of codeforces

It also contains sample templates currently for C++, Java and Python
